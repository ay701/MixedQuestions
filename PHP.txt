- Session vs Cookie vs Cache
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6253633/cookies-vs-sessions

Session:

IDU is stored on server (i.e. server-side)
Safer (because of 1)
Expiration can not be set, session variables will be expired when users close the browser. (nowadays it is stored for 24 minutes as default in php)

Cookies:

IDU is stored on web-browser (i.e. client-side)
Not very safe, since hackers can reach and get your information (because of 1)
Expiration can be set (see setcookies() for more information)

- Trait vs Abstract Class
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39466521/difference-between-trait-and-an-abstract-class-in-php

Traits allow you to share code between your classes without forcing you into a specific class hierarchy. Say you want all your classes to have the convenient utility method foo($bar); without traits you have two choices:

implement it individually with code redundancy in each class
inherit from a common (abstract) ancestor class

- include() vs require() vs require_once()

- Error handling

- objects are they passed by value or by reference? 
Value
