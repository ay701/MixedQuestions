Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern that deals with how components get hold of their dependencies.
Dependency Injection is a software design in which components are given their dependencies instead of hard coding them within the component. It relieves a component from locating the dependency and makes dependencies configurable. It also helps in making components reusable, maintainable and testable.

The AngularJS injector subsystem is in charge of creating components, resolving their dependencies, and providing them to other components as requested.

AngularJS provides a supreme Dependency Injection mechanism. It provides following core components which can be injected into each other as dependencies.

Service
