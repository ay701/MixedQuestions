Here are the key differences between the patterns:

·    MVP Pattern
o    The view is more loosely coupled to the model. The presenter is responsible for binding the model to the view.
o    Easier to unit test because interaction with the view is through an interface
o    Usually, view presenter map one to one. Complex views may have multi presenters.

·    MVC Pattern
o    Controllers are based on behaviors and can be shared across views
o    Can be responsible for determining which view to display (Front Controller Pattern)
